# Data-Science-Study-Plan

I have decided to create a 6-month long study plan to delve deeper into the field of data science, both through theory and projects. I have recently completed the Data Science Certificate from Waterloo University and felt that this certificate only provided me with a somewhat surface level understanding of data science theory and applications, which is why I am embarking on this study plan. The last month of this study plan focuses on job preparation.

The study plan is based around three learning sources: 
1. Mathematics for Machine Learning by  A. Aldo Faisal, Cheng Soon Ong, and Marc Peter Deisenroth, 2020
2. Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow by Aurelien Geron, Thrid Edition, 2022
3. Standford's CS229 course

I have chosen the Hands-on Machine Learning textbook because I find each topic to be very well explained with appropriate examples and the fact that the author has published the notebooks that go along with each chapter on GitHub. The book thoroughly covers many different machine learning models and shows how they can be implemented using python libraries. The aim of this book for me is better understand how each model can be implemented, which models to use and when, some "rules-of-thumb" of machine learning, and to analyze real model applications to data.

Moreover, I want to make sure I understand these models not only at the surface level, which is why I will be going through Mathematics for Machine Learning and Standford's CS229 course; mathematically undertand what the model is doing.

Lastly, I want to apply the knowledge I am acquiring over time, which is why I will be completing projects (Kaggle, Geron's book, other sources...)

- Attempt a reinforcement learning task (e.g., OpenAI Gym).

**Weeks 21-24: Capstone Projects**
- Choose 1-2 challenging projects:
- Kaggle competitions: Select high-profile ones like Tabular Playground or NLP challenges.
- Real-world dataset from public repositories (e.g., UCI ML Repository).
- Apply end-to-end ML pipeline:
- Data cleaning, exploration, feature engineering, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment.
- Document the project in detail:
- Write blog posts or create videos explaining the problem, solution, and results.

### Phase 4: Job Preparation (Weeks 25-30)
#### Goals
- Prepare for technical interviews.

**Weeks 28-30: Application and Networking** 
- Polish GitHub portfolio and Kaggle profile.
- Network via LinkedIn, attend meetups, and contribute to open-source projects.
- Apply to jobs with tailored resumes highlighting relevant projects.


## Repository Organization

- Each month will have its own folder which will include a detailed week-by-week study plan for the month, my notes on the month's topics (from the textbooks and CS229), and maybe some interesting articles to read related to the topics at hand.
- There will be a seperate folder that will include the projects I will be completing over the course of the study plan.
- A resources folder with links to pdf versions of textbooks and links to repositories of interest.
